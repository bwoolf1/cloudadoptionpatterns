# Identify Entities and Aggregates

Start your microservices design with the idea of an Entity. An Entity is an object that is distinguished by its identity. Entities have unique identifiers. Entities also have attributes that might change, but the identifier for the person stays the same. An example of an entity is a person. A person has an unchanging identifier, such as a Social Security Number in the United States. That same person has a given name, a surname, an address, and a phone number. Any of the attributes can change, but the person doesn't change.

Evans notes that entity objects must have a well-defined lifecycle and a good definition of what the identity relationship isâ€”what it means to be the same thing as another thing.

From Entity-Relationship modeling, you know that sometimes Entities might be well-defined and have a specific well-known identifier, but might not live independently. Evans calls the combination of Entities an Aggregate.

You can find a simple example of the Entity/Aggregate relationship in a retail store. If you go to the soda aisle in a grocery store, you can buy a 12-pack carton of soda. Each can in the carton has a bar code to identify it individually, but you can't buy a single can from the carton. The cans are entities that are referred to as Dependent Entities. The root entity is the carton. The carton is the Aggregate because it defines the Dependent Entities' lifecycle (at least as far as the retail store is concerned)

The opposite of an Entity is a Value Object. Value Objects have no conceptual identity. You can't tell one Value Object from any other of its type. If you treat all objects in a system as Entities, the process to assess and manage the identity of each object can become overwhelming and hurt performance. Instead, care only about the attributes of a Value Object and that each Value Object can be treated as unchanged from the creation of the object until it is destroyed.

Consider an example of a Value Object. When you go to the bank, you usually want to access your bank account. Your bank account is an entity. If you query your current account balance, the result is a Value Object. The next time that you query your account balance, a different Value Object is returned with your new current balance.

Usually, when you identify the Entities and Aggregates, most of the Value Objects "fall out" of the process.  You don't have to go explicitly looking for them, they simply start to accumulate - you just keep a running list of them as the process carries on.

Another thing to keep in mind is that Aggregates usually either succeed or fail as a whole. They are the boundaries of transactionality.
