# Bounded Contexts

A Bounded Context explicitly defines the boundaries of your model. This concept is critical in large software projects. A Bounded Context sets the limits around what a specific team works on and helps them to define their own vocabulary within that particular context.

Take the example of a customer in retail. In one context, a customer is a person who buys products from a store. In another context, a customer is a person who a retailer markets its products to. The customer is the same but is in different bounded contexts, each of which act on the customer entity based on their own rules.

When you define a bounded context, you define who uses it, how they use it, where it applies within a larger application context, and what it consists of in terms of things like Swagger documentation and code repositories.
