Services
===

In most domains, some operations don't conceptually belong to any specific object. Previous design methods tried to force those operations into an entity-based model, often with adverse consequences, especially for operations that operated on a group of related Entities. Instead, you model those objects as stand-alone interfaces called Services. The rules for a good service are as follows:

* It is stateless
* The interface is defined in terms of other elements of your domain model (Entities, Aggregates and Value Objects)
* It refers to a domain concept that doesn't naturally correspond to any particular Entity or Value Object

These operations are part of the business domainâ€”they're not technical issues of implementation. Things like "Login," "Authentication," and "Logging" aren't appropriate Services of this type. However, a concept like "Funds Transfer" in banking or "Adjudication" in insurance might be.
