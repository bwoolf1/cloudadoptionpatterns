# Cloud Security

This is a placeholder for a major section. Chris added some stuff under Container Architecture
that touches on this:
* _Container Registry Vulnerability Scan_
* __CI/CD Pipeline Vulnerability Scan_
* _Multiple Vulnerability Scanners_
* _Birthing Pool_

_Overlay Network_ might be another candidate. _Log Aggregator_ ditto. Maybe instead of a separate
section, we need to specifically flag security related patterns?

More stuff:
* Every node is firewalled (don't rely on a perimeter firewall, defence in depth)
* Real-time auditing (Threatstack)
* ... (WIP)
